This problemset is about creating an app

The data set is "UAH-lower-troposphere-long.csv.bz2" which is a temperature report dataset.
With temps based on region and year.

The main tab doesn't have any interactive things.

The plot tab has a scatter plot showing the temps for each month.
You can effect this data by changing what year is selected with the slider
or seeing what region each point is from by changing the colors.
And there is text that averages temp for the given year

The table tab has a data table on it.
You can specify what region is shown with the widget.
And the text will react to the region and give the avg temp for the years 1979 and 2022.

this is my WORKING app
